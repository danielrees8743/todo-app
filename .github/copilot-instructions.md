# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Build a simple, maintainable application that is easy to extend and test.

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
- React Router v6
- lucide-react
- Tanstack Query

## Coding Style

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Prefer arrow functions for components.
- Use explicit return types for functions where helpful.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Ensure all components are responsive.
- Use strict equality (`===`) checks.

## Project Context

- This is a Todo application.
- Keep the UI clean and minimalist.

# Copilot Instructions – App Development Guide

## Goal

## General Rules

- Keep code simple and readable
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid premature optimization
- Follow existing project structure
- Write reusable, modular code

## Project Structure

- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Keep files small and focused
- Use clear, consistent naming
- if using custom hooks, prefix with "use" and place them in thier own hooks folder

## Development Steps

1. Initialize the project with basic configuration
2. Set up core folders and base files
3. Implement main application logic
4. Add UI/components as needed
5. Connect data layer (if applicable)
6. Handle errors and edge cases
7. Add basic tests
8. Refactor for clarity and simplicity

## Coding Guidelines

- Use comments only when necessary
- Avoid deeply nested logic
- Prefer pure functions where possible
- Handle errors gracefully

## Testing

- Write simple, meaningful tests
- Cover critical logic paths
- Avoid over-testing trivial code

## Output Expectations

- Working, runnable code
- No unused variables or dead code
- Minimal dependencies
- Consistent formatting

## Out of Scope

- Over-engineered abstractions
- Unused features
- Experimental or unstable libraries unless specified

## Feature Requests

- Implement features incrementally
- Prioritize core functionality first
- Ensure each feature is complete before moving on and mark the done column on the feature feature.md file
